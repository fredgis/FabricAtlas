All notable changes to Fabric Atlas are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.2] - 2026-08-29

### Changed

- Rebuilt the first-sync experience as a responsive full-width hero with animated lineage, live workspace metrics and a stronger synchronization panel.
- Enhanced Governance Overview with animated depth and a circular health pulse.
- Replaced conflicting named `max-w-*` utilities with dedicated layout classes.
- Added a Rayfin workspace-name variable and robust fallbacks so deployment screens never show `undefined`.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-08-29

### Changed

- Every newly deployed build now opens on the synchronization screen once, even when an older catalog already exists.
- Lineage selection no longer recalculates the focused layout or moves the selected node.
- Added an explicit **Focus selection** action for intentionally rebuilding the visible path.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- First-sync command screen with real synchronization stages and progress.
- Synchronization progress and status in the persistent application header.
- Connected-component grouping for large lineage maps.

### Changed

- Dark theme is now the default; a light preference is stored when selected.
- Scanner lineage is normalized into source-to-consumer direction.
- Impact mode shows only the selected dependency path instead of dimming the entire workspace.
- The lifecycle layout now separates orchestration, transformation, storage, serving and consumption.
- Catalog, Asset Catalog, Config and Sensitivity groups start collapsed.
- Governance Overview uses a stronger workspace banner and clearer operational hierarchy.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- Transitive upstream and downstream impact analysis in Map & lineage.
- Directional arrows and relationship labels for active lineage paths.
- Staged `Ingest & transform → Store → Model → Consume` layout.
- Minimap, zoom, fit, type, health and search controls.
- Item and object lineage modes for tables, columns, measures and consumers.
- Inspector tabs for summary, schema, effective access and run history.
- Deep-linkable lineage item, mode, filters and selected table.
- About page with version, build, repository, workspace and release information.

### Changed

- Polished the existing Fabric Atlas shell without replacing its navigation model.
- Improved responsive layouts across catalog, access, jobs, configuration and sensitivity views.
- Centralized lineage, object and status colors in the shared theme.
- Improved keyboard focus, semantic control states, scrollbars and reduced-motion behavior.
